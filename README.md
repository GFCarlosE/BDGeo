#  SalleAroundMe Repository DataBase

This repository contains the database scripts and related components for managing and maintaining our database. The database includes stored procedures, functions, tables, and triggers to support our application.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

### 1. ScriptFinal
This directory contains the final version of the database script. It is the primary script that defines the database schema, tables, and relationships.

### 2. StoredProcedures
In this directory, you will find stored procedures that are used to encapsulate specific database operations. These procedures provide an interface for executing common tasks within the database.

### 3. Functions
The 'functions' directory houses user-defined functions that can be used to manipulate data or perform calculations within the database.

### 4. Tables
This directory contains SQL scripts for creating and modifying database tables. The tables represent the structured data within the database and define the relationships between different data entities.

### 5. Triggers
Triggers are defined in this directory. Triggers are database objects that automatically respond to specific events or actions, allowing for automated processes and data validation.
